1.	How do I approach designing software?
	
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
After working on this project, I now know how to created 3D objects in a virtual scene.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
For this project I tried to design each object’s shape individually and then place them in the scene.  Next, I added the textures and then the lighting.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
For future work I would follow the same process.  First, I would create each object, and then add more detail as needed.

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
While working on the n3D scene I tried to write reusable and modular code.  This helped me in my final execution.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration helped my development a lot.  Using the same mesh for most of the shapes allowed me to reuse code rather than rewriting it.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Throughout the milestones I learned new skills which I was able to add to my final project.  Reusing available code and create modularity helped me complete my project.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The knowledge and skills from this course have helped me figure out new problem-solving strategies.  These strategies will help me in any future classes by being able to approach programming in new ways.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The knowledge and skills from this course will help me be a more reliable team member in my professional progression.  Knowing how to code a variety of different ways is a valuable skill to have,.
